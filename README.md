# Reason behind Space Horizon

In our busy lives, we often miss out on the magnificent astronomical events that the universe has to offer. Whether it's a meteor shower, a solar eclipse, or a planetary alignment, these inspiring moments can pass by unnoticed.

- Other pages extend this layout using {% extends "space/layout.html" %} to inherit the common structure
- This contains of the elements that make up the common navigation bar seen thought the web application.

**Login.html** :

- This HTML page is for users who already have an account on Space Horizon.
- It allows users to input their username and password.
- Upon submission, the input data is sent to Django‚Äôs login view, where the user‚Äôs credentials are authenticated using Django's built-in authentication system.
- If authentication is successful, the user is logged in.

```python
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate,login,logout
user = authenticate(request, username=username, password=password)
login(request, user)
```

**Register.html** :

- New users who do not have accounts on Space Horizon are redirected to the register.html page.
- This page allows users to create new accounts by providing information such as their username, email, and password.
- Upon form submission, the data is sent to the Django view, where the user account is created. After successful registration, the user is automatically logged in.
- Once logged in, users gain access to additional features such as watchlists, notifications, bookmarks, and posting comments, which are not available to non-logged-in users.
- This is done just like the login in page using  Django's built-in authentication system.

```python
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate,login,logout
 user = User.objects.create_user(username, email, password)
 user.save()
 login(request, user)
```

### **Other files :**

**manage.py :**

- manage.py is the command-line utility for interacting with your Django project.
- It serves as the entry point for tasks such as running the development server, creating database migrations, and creating app specific tasks.

**db.sqlite3** :

- db.sqlite3 is the default SQLite database file used by Django for storing the project‚Äôs data.
- It's a lightweight, server less database that's automatically created.
